# AutoKaggler Titanic Pipeline

Meet AutoKaggler – a fully automated agent that wakes up, secures the Kaggle Titanic dataset, engineers competition-ready features, trains multiple models, and hands you a validated `submission.csv` without requiring any manual babysitting. Everything from dataset acquisition to leaderboard-ready predictions is orchestrated via structured JSON I/O, keeping the run reproducible and auditable end-to-end.

## Quick demo: hands-off Titanic submissions

1. Provide a simple task description as JSON.
2. AutoKaggler resolves the data source (Kaggle → cached copy → bundled sample), fixes random seeds across numpy/LightGBM/XGBoost/sklearn, performs stratified CV, and logs diagnostics plus feature importances.
3. The agent emits an `AgentResult` JSON tagged with `#KGNINJA` and leaves a Kaggle-formatted `submission.csv` only after validation succeeds.

### Example `TaskInput`

```json
{
  "profile": "boosting",
  "data_source": "auto",
  "use_ensemble": true,
  "notes": "Hands-off leaderboard run"
}
```

### Example `AgentResult`

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "meta": {
    "profile": "boosting",
    "tags": ["#KGNINJA"],
    "log_file": ".agent_logs/run-20240101-120000.log"
  },
  "result": {
    "cv_mean_accuracy": 0.84,
    "cv_std": 0.02,
    "model_name": "Voting(LogReg+RF+LightGBM)",
    "submission_path": ".agent_tmp/submissions/submission-20240101-120000.csv",
    "data_source": "kaggle_cached",
    "feature_importances": [
      {"model": "boost", "feature": "num__FarePerPerson", "importance": 0.312},
      {"model": "rf", "feature": "num__Age", "importance": 0.201}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Sample submission preview

| PassengerId | Survived |
|-------------|----------|
| 892         | 0        |

| 894         | 0        |

*Preview generated from the bundled sample dataset; real Kaggle runs will match the official test.csv row count.*

## Why it works

* 🔁 **Self-initialisation & logging** – runtime directories, structured logs, and profile selection happen automatically, ensuring every run is captured.
* 🧮 **Composed feature engineering** – modular steps derive passenger titles, family sizes, cabin presence, `Age*Pclass`, and fare-per-person interactions that plug straight into a reusable preprocessing stack.
* 🧠 **Profile registry** – toggle between `fast` (logistic regression), `power` (random forest), and `boosting` (LightGBM/XGBoost with soft-voting) profiles or inject your own via the registry.
* 🧪 **Deterministic evaluation** – Stratified K-Fold CV with fixed seeds reports mean and variance in logs and results, stabilising leaderboard expectations.
* 📊 **Interpretability out of the box** – feature importance summaries are logged and returned alongside model metadata for quick inspection.
* 🔐 **Robust data fallbacks** – Kaggle API download is attempted first, cached copies are reused on failure, and a bundled synthetic sample keeps offline runs unblocked.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Pipe a JSON payload to the agent entrypoint:

```bash
echo '{"profile": "fast", "data_source": "auto"}' | python -m autokaggler
```

Artefacts land in `.agent_tmp/` (datasets & submissions) and `.agent_logs/` (structured logs). Set `PROFILE=power` or `PROFILE=boosting` in the environment to change the default behaviour, or override within the `TaskInput` JSON.

### Profiles & ensembles

| Profile   | Description                                                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fast`    | Logistic regression baseline – quick feedback for iteration.           |
| `power`   | Random forest powered by the engineered feature set.                   |
| `boosting`| LightGBM/XGBoost (falls back to gradient boosting) with optional soft voting ensemble. |

Pass `{"profile": "boosting", "use_ensemble": true}` to enable soft voting between logistic regression, random forest, and the boosting model. Other profiles run their standalone estimators.

### Kaggle credentials

Provide Kaggle API credentials (via environment variables or `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`) to unlock real competition downloads. AutoKaggler reuses cached files on subsequent runs and gracefully degrades to the bundled sample data if the API is unreachable.

## Development

Install optional dependencies and execute the regression tests:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```

The `data/sample/` directory holds the synthetic Titanic dataset used for tests and offline experimentation.
